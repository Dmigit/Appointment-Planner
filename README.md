# Appointment Planner üìù

## What is this project about?

In this project, I used React to develop a web app that allows you to add a contact to a list of **contacts** and, on another page, lets you add **appointments** with the contacts that you've added to your list. This project doesn't look too pretty but I was focusing more on getting better at using functional components and hooks than on styling the page.

This is the contact page:

## What I learned

This project was challenging for me on several steps along the way because I am still getting used to hooks and passing props to function components. I had gotten used to class components and so I was getting a bit thrown off sometimes. However, this project did strengthen my React skills because now I have a better understanding of how components are generally supposed to interact and "collaborate" to make a project work. I'll get better as I work on increasingly complex projects, and I will build on these skills when I begin to develop frontends for my dApps!
